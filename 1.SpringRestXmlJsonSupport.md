# Spring REST JSON Response


-	In order to have Json support, we need have jackson-databind dependency on the classpath
-	And use @Restcontroller or @Controller + @ResponseBody


				<!-- Jackson JSON Processor -->
				<dependency>
					<groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
					<artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
					<version>2.4.1</version>
				</dependency>
				
##	Spring REST XML Response

-	In order to XML response in spring mvc applications we just needs to annotate our java pojo's with jaxb annotations
-	Since jaxb will be present in the classpath by default, spring will be able to marshal java objects to xml representation automatically
-	Spring will HttpMessageConverter to convert an object to the xml representation requested by the user
-	As we want XML this marshaling is done by the Jaxb2RootElementHttpMessageConverter provided by Spring which is automatically registered in spring context if JAXB libraries are found in classpath				
-	As we are using JRE 8 to run this application and it has JAXB inbuilt, so I do not need to add external dependency through maven


### Annotate POJO with JAXB 

-	EmployeeVO.java

				@XmlRootElement (name = "employee")
				@XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.NONE)
				public class EmployeeVO implements Serializable
				{
					private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
				 
					@XmlAttribute
					private Integer id;
					 
					@XmlElement
					private String firstName;
					 
					@XmlElement
					private String lastName;
					 
					@XmlElement
					private String email;
					 
					public EmployeeVO(Integer id, String firstName, String lastName, String email) {
						super();
						this.id = id;
						this.firstName = firstName;
						this.lastName = lastName;
						this.email = email;
					}
					 
					public EmployeeVO(){
						 
					}
				 
					//Setters and Getters
				 
					@Override
					public String toString() {
						return "EmployeeVO [id=" + id + ", firstName=" + firstName
								+ ", lastName=" + lastName + ", email=" + email + "]";
					}
				}
				
-	EmployeeListVO.java:				
				
				@XmlRootElement (name="employees")
				public class EmployeeListVO implements Serializable
				{
					private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
					 
					private List<EmployeeVO> employees = new ArrayList<EmployeeVO>();
				 
					public List<EmployeeVO> getEmployees() {
						return employees;
					}
				 
					public void setEmployees(List<EmployeeVO> employees) {
						this.employees = employees;
					}
				}
				
###	RestController


				@RestController
				public class EmployeeRESTController
				{
					@RequestMapping(value = "/employees")
					public EmployeeListVO getAllEmployees()
					{
						EmployeeListVO employees = new EmployeeListVO();
						 
						EmployeeVO empOne = new EmployeeVO(1,"Lokesh","Gupta","howtodoinjava@gmail.com");
						EmployeeVO empTwo = new EmployeeVO(2,"Amit","Singhal","asinghal@yahoo.com");
						EmployeeVO empThree = new EmployeeVO(3,"Kirti","Mishra","kmishra@gmail.com");
						 
						 
						employees.getEmployees().add(empOne);
						employees.getEmployees().add(empTwo);
						employees.getEmployees().add(empThree);
						 
						return employees;
					}
					 
					@RequestMapping(value = "/employees/{id}")
					public ResponseEntity<EmployeeVO> getEmployeeById (@PathVariable("id") int id)
					{
						if (id <= 3) {
							EmployeeVO employee = new EmployeeVO(1,"Lokesh","Gupta","howtodoinjava@gmail.com");
							return new ResponseEntity<EmployeeVO>(employee, HttpStatus.OK);
						}
						return new ResponseEntity(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
					}
				}
				
				


### Xml Support in Spring boot

-	To get xml support in spring boot application add jackson-dataformat-xml dependency
